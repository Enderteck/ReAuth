# ReAuth

A Mod to Login again while Minecraft is running. 
No lengthy restarts for an expired session required.

## Overview

Capabilities:

- Fixes the Problem of having to restart your Client when your Session is invalid
- Shows whether your Session is valid
- Change Accounts while Minecraft is running
- Change Username for playing offline

The Mod is clientside only - it will not work in servers mods folder  
An invisible Login-Button is available in the MainMenu to be wrapped by CustomMainMenu (Button-ID 17325)(1.7.10+)

While a Mod handling login credentials may sound risky, the sourcecode is visible here for independent verification.

## Branches

Since ReAuth supports a lot of Minecraft versions across two Modloaders their respective branches are listed here.  
Versions below 4.0 will be updated to support Microsoft authentication as soon as possible.
