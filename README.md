# ReAuth
A Mod to Re-Login to Mojang while Minecraft is still running

Capabilities:
 - Fixes the Problem of having to restart your Client when your Session is invalid
 - Shows whether your Session is valid
 - Change Accounts while Minecraft is running
 - Change Username for playing offline (has to be enabled in config)


The Mod is clientside only - it will not work in servers mods folder

Just hit the "Re-Login" Button in the Multiplayermenu and enter your Logindata, after that you will be able to login on your Servers

An invisible Login-Button is available in the MainMenu to be wrapped by CustomMainMenu (Button-ID 17325)(1.7.10+)

I know that entering your Logindata simply into a Mod might sound risky, but thats why i have the Source here
